\hypertarget{Works_one}{}\subsection{Leap year algorithm}\label{Works_one}
An algorithm to determine if it is a leap year, adapted from the logic shown in this wikipedia page\+: Accessed September, 2016 \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#Algorithm}{\tt https\+://en.\+wikipedia.\+org/wiki/\+Leap\+\_\+year\#\+Algorithm}\hypertarget{Works_two}{}\subsection{Day of the week algorithm}\label{Works_two}
An algorithm to determine the day of the week of the first day of the year, adapted from the algortihm on the \char`\"{}disparate variation\char`\"{} of Gauss\textquotesingle{}s algorithm, shown here\+: Accessed September, 2016 \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#Algorithm}{\tt https\+://en.\+wikipedia.\+org/wiki/\+Leap\+\_\+year\#\+Algorithm}\hypertarget{Works_three}{}\subsection{Regular Expressions}\label{Works_three}
Regular expressions were built for date parsing using a tutorial written by Jan Goyvaerts. Accessed September 2016 \href{https://www.regular-expressions.info/dates.html}{\tt https\+://www.\+regular-\/expressions.\+info/dates.\+html}\hypertarget{Works_four}{}\subsection{Flask Extensions \& Best Practices}\label{Works_four}
We consulted the official Flask documentation while writing our server, and adapted many of the examples to fit our needs. Since much of what we used is simply The Way to implement a given feature, we did not cite them individually within the code.

Flask Documentation by Armin Ronacher Accessed September 2016 \href{http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/}{\tt http\+://flask.\+pocoo.\+org/docs/0.\+11/}\hypertarget{Works_five}{}\subsection{Flask Micro-\/\+Blog Tutorial}\label{Works_five}
This extensive tutorial was used as a model for our authentication, and was also where we got the Bootstrap code for our client-\/side C\+SS.

The Flask Mega-\/\+Tutorial by Miguel Grinberg Accessed September 2016 \href{http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world}{\tt http\+://blog.\+miguelgrinberg.\+com/post/the-\/flask-\/mega-\/tutorial-\/part-\/i-\/hello-\/world}\hypertarget{Works_six}{}\subsection{Bootstrap C\+SS}\label{Works_six}
As mentioned above, we sourced the original Bootstrap C\+SS from Miguel Grinberg\textquotesingle{}s Flask tutorial. The Bootstrap itself was written by unnamed employees of Twitter. Accessed September 2016

We used a function from a stackexchange post written by user \textquotesingle{}Arun P Johny\textquotesingle{} to trim out unwanted characters from the client-\/side form data. There is probably a better way to do so, but it eluded our Google-\/\+Fu.
